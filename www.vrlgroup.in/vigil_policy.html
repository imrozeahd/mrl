                      <strong>1.  BACKGROUND </strong>
                      <br><br>
                      1.1. In  the Companies Act, 2013 under Section 177 read with Companies (Meetings of  Board and its powers) Rules 2014 mandates every listed company or every company  having borrowed loans of Rs.50 crore or more or having accepted the deposits  from public shall establish a vigil mechanism for the directors and employees  to report genuine concerns. Such a vigil mechanism shall provide for adequate  safeguards against victimization of persons who use such mechanism and make  provision for direct access to the chairperson of the Audit Committee in  appropriate or exceptional cases. 
                       <br><br>
                       1.2. VRL  Logistics Limited has implemented a robust mechanism for identification of  malpractices within the organization and the present day reporting of such  ongoings is being made to the highest authorities including the Chairman  himself. Due confidentiality in the matter is maintained at all times and  suitable rewards are extended to such 'whistle blowers'. Also, the Company  accords due importance to the internal branch inspection function which  escalates its findings to the Chairman and Managing Director. Individual  function owners also have their own informal communication channels within the  organizations and the Company has benefitted from these methodologies in the  past. However, a formal vigil mechanism policy was not documented for  information of all and now we would need to document a vigil mechanism within  the organization.
                        <br><br>
                        1.3. In  a recent communication issued to the employees, the Chairman has encouraged the  employees to directly report to him any wrong doings in the Company for the  overall betterment of the organization. At the same time, the employees have  also been warned on desisting from resorting to such a practice to harass individuals  under the garb of confidentiality. As a policy, the Company completely  disregards anonymous communication and also tries to identify such individuals  who resort to these practices to target others. In the recent past, there have  been several instances of action being initiated on such troublemakers. 
                        <br><br>
                        1.4. Under  these circumstances, VRL Logistics Limited (VRL), being a responsible player in  the industry proposes to establish a Whistle Blower (vigil) mechanism and to formulate  a whistle blower policy. 
                        
                        
                        <br><br><br>
                        <strong>2.  POLICY OBJECTIVES. </strong><br>
                        <br>
                        2.1. A Whistle Blower (Vigil) mechanism provides a  channel to the employees to report to the management, concerns about unethical  behavior, actual or suspected fraud or violation of the Codes of conduct or  policy. The mechanism provides for adequate safeguards against victimization of  employees to avail of the mechanism and also provide for direct access to the  Chairman of the Audit Committee in exceptional cases. <p></p>
                      <p>2.2. Having a policy in place does not absolve  individual employees from their duty of maintaining confidentiality in the  course of their routine work, in tune with the demands of the situation, nor  can this mechanism be used as a route for raising malicious or unfounded  allegations against people in authority and / or colleagues in general. </p>
                      <p><strong>3.  SCOPE OF THE POLICY. </strong></p>
                      <p>3.1. This Policy covers malpractices and events  which have taken place / suspected to have taken place, misuse or abuse of  authority, fraud or suspected fraud, violation of company rules, manipulations,  negligence causing danger to public health and safety, misappropriation of  monies, and other matters or activities on account of which the interest of the  Company is affected and formally reported by whistle blowers concerning individual  / a cartel of employees. </p>

"Nodal  Officer" means an officer of the Company nominated by the Audit Committee to  receive protected disclosures from whistleblowers, maintaining records thereof,  placing the same before the Audit Committee for its disposal and informing the  whistle blower the result thereof. </p>
                      <p>&nbsp;4.7.  "Protected Disclosure" means a concern raised by an employee or group of  employees of the Company, through a written communication and made in good  faith which discloses or demonstrates information about an unethical or  improper activity under the title "SCOPE OF THE POLICY" with respect to the  Company. However, the Protected Disclosures should be factual and not  speculative or in the nature of an interpretation / conclusion and should  contain as much specific information as possible to allow for proper assessment  of the nature and extent of the concern.<br>

  <strong>9.  PROTECTION.</strong> <br>
                        <br>
                        9.1. No unfair treatment will be meted out to a  whistle blower by virtue of his/ her having reported a Protected Disclosure  under this policy. The company, as a policy, condemns any kind of  discrimination, harassment, victimization or any other unfair employment  practice being adopted against Whistle Blowers. Complete protection will,  therefore, be given to Whistle Blowers against any unfair practice like  retaliation, threat or intimidation of termination / suspension of service,  disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, refusal of promotion or the like including  any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the Whistle Blower's right  to continue to perform his duties / functions including making further  Protected Disclosure. The company will take steps to minimize difficulties,  which the Whistle Blower may experience as a result of making the Protected  Disclosure. Thus if the Whistle Blower is required to give evidence in criminal  or disciplinary proceedings, the Company will arrange for the Whistle Blower to  receive advice about the procedure etc. <br>
                        <br>

                        9.3. The identity of the Whistle Blower shall be  kept confidential to the extent possible and permitted under law. The identity  of the complainant will not be revealed unless he himself has made either his  details public or disclosed his identity to any other office or authority. In  the event of the identity of the complainant being disclosed, the audit  committee is authorized to initiate appropriate action as per extant  regulations against the person or agency making such disclosure. The identity  of the Whistleblower, if known, shall remain confidential to those persons  directly involved in applying this policy, unless the issue requires  investigation by law enforcement agencies, in which case members of the  organization are subject to subpoena. </p>
                      <p>9.4. Any other Employee assisting in the said  investigation shall also be protected to the same extent as the Whistle Blower. </p>
                      <p>9.5. Provided however that the complainant before  making a complaint has reasonable belief that an issue exists and he has acted  in good faith. Any complaint not made in good faith as assessed as such by the  audit committee shall be viewed seriously and the complainant shall be subject  to disciplinary action as per the certified standing orders of the Company.  This policy does not protect an employee from an adverse action taken  independent of his disclosure of unethical and improper practice etc. unrelated  to a disclosure made pursuant to this policy. <br>
                        <br>
  <strong>10.  ACCESS TO CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE </strong></p>
                      <p>10.1. The Whistle Blower shall have right to  access Chairman of the Audit Committee directly in exceptional cases and the  Chairman of the Audit Committee is authorized to prescribe suitable directions  in this regard. </p>
                      <p><strong>11. COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
                      <p>11.1. A whistleblower policy cannot be effective  unless it is properly communicated to employees. Employees shall be informed  through by office circular, publishing in notice board and in the web site of  the company. </p>
                      <p><strong>12.  RETENTION OF DOCUMENTS. </strong></p>
                      <p>12.1. All Protected disclosures documented along  with the results of Investigation relating thereto, shall be retained by the  Nodal Officer for a period of 5 (five) years or such other period as specified  by any other law in force, whichever is more. <br>
